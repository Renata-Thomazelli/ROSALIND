## 1.1 In problem 3 
>The Challenge is to return The slice of a string from indices a through b and c through d (with space in between), inclusively. In other words, we should include elements s[b] and s[d] in our slice.

## 1.2 In problem 4 
>Challenge: 
>>Return: The sum of all odd integers from a through b, inclusively. We have these integers 4916 and 9583

## 1.3 In problem 5 
>This is a really good challenge. We have a doc.txt and we have to return just the even-numbers line of it. 
>>for this challenge you can:  
>>>* Do a __loop__ or 
>>>* You can also __`import sys`__ and __`import intertools`__

# 3 BIOINFORMATIC     
 
>## 3.1 Counting DNA Nucleotides
>>In this exercise we need to count it of the DNA molecules:  adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).
>>Here I did a dictionary just to see how it works e tran I used count() Method to count it of the letters we have in this string.
    
>## 3.2 Transcribing DNA into RNA
>>Here we use __`replace()`__ method to change Uracil into Thymine molecules into the string.

>## 3.3 Complement a Strand of DNA
>>Here we worked with __dictinary__ to created a key and value for it replace that is necessary to do.
>>For to do this replacement we used a __loop__ __`for`__ __`in`__.
>>In the and we print this new string in the __reverse order__.
>>We also used __case low__ and __case upper__.
